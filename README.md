# MSDS_Practicum_I
Kaggle_LSST_Classification_Challenge
In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Data Science at Regis University, 
the following Practicum I Project has been completed. 
The project was to develop a supervised learning neural network that classifies astronomical objects based on 
light variance coming from the source over a specified observation timeframe.

Data Science Task
The project will start with exploratory data analysis and feature engineering tasks to determine the optimal variable for 
the machine learning study. Next, the project will develop a neural network that classifies types astronomical objects 
based on their light curves. Finally, the model will be used to predict the category of the astronomical object for the test set.
